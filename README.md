# endangered-pokedex-db-backend

To get started:

- `git clone` the repo 
- Make a .env file in the root of the project for your MySQL DB credentials to be stored in your local machine. The dotenv process should know how to fetch the credentials as needed. 
- `yarn install` this should get all the node modules needed
- `yarn start` will run nodemon so you don't have to restart the process every time a change is made
- Navigate to `localhost:60500` to see the server app running locally
